# User Profile Card

One of the superpowers of Tailwind CSS is how it enables you to prototype and iterate directly in the browser.

In this section, we'll do just that!

## Redesigning a user profile card

We'll take a user profile card (inspired from the Epic Web Notes App) as our playground for design iteration:

![User profile screen](/user-profile-starting-point.png)

Instead of using a design tool like Figma, we'll leverage Tailwind's utility classes and Intellisense tooling to rapidly iterate directly in code.

## Iterative design steps

We'll break down separate aspects of the user profile card design, and improve them step by step.

Things we'll cover:

- Typography and spacing
- Line length and its impact on readability
- Depth and Elevation
- Alternative header & footer layouts
- Gradient backgrounds

## Ready to rock?

Let's do this!
