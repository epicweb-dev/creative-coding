# Aesthetic Touches

Let's add a subtle gradient backgound to our card for some final touches.

This will help give the drop header stand out a bit more, and make the card feel really polished.

🐨 Change the background color of the entire card from `slate-100` to `white`.

## Background gradient

We want our gradient to go from the drop header to the footer. There is currently no single HTML element containing all element for that section, so...

🐨 Wrap the `<header>` and `<p>{user.bio}</p>` inside a parent `<div>`.

Ok great — now let's style that wrapper!

🐨 Move the `margin-top` and `border-top` classes from the `<header>` to the new parent wrapper.

🐨 Give the wrapper a top-to-bottom background gradient. The gradient should fade to white at the bottom, but the `from` color is up to you — have a play with various colors!

	The solution uses a `slate-200` color at `75%` opacity, which works quite
	well.
