# Create Depth with Elevation & Separation

The next thing we can do to improve our design is adding some depth and separation to our elements.

Just like for the typography in the previous step, we don't want anything too drastic.

Quite often, in design... less is more.

## Elevate the profile card

🐨 Add a `box-shadow` with the `lg` level to the card container.

We can make that soft shadow really shine with a subtle but sharp additional shadow:

🐨 Add a `ring-1` of the `slate-300` color to the same element.

## Give the prfile image some separation

🐨 Add the same `box-shadow` and `ring` treatment to the `<img>` element.

That shadow will look drastically different (and effective) depending on the avatar colors.

We can make it work much better in every scenario by adding a white circle around the image.

🐨 Add a `ring-offset` of `6px` to the `<img>` element.

<callout-info>
	The `6px` ring offset value doesn't exist on the default Tailwind theme. Use
	an arbitrary value for that!
