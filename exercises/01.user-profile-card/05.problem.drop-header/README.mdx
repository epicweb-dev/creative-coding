# Drop Header

Honestly, our card looks super nice at this point. But let's bring some extra delight by creating a fancy "drop header" for our card.

It will look more interesting, and help give the card a more vertical aspect-ratio.

🐨 Add a `margin-top` of level `32` to the `<header>` element.

🐨 Add a `border-top` of `1px` and of the `slate-300` color to the `<header>` element.

**Where is the top offset?**

Our `margin-top` has pushed the entire card down. We did not want this!

This is due to the **collapsing margins** behaviour of CSS.

## Breaking out of collapsing margins

There are a few ways to fix our header offset.

Adding `overflow: auto` is one of them.

Since in the previous step we had to replicate the `border-bottom-radius` on our clickable footer, let's use that!

🐨 Add the `overflow-auto` class to the card container.

🐨 Remove the `rounded-b-3xl` class from the `<a>` tag inside the `<footer>` — it's no longer need with the card's overflow management.
