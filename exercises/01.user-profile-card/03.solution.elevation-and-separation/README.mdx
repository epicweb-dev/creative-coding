# Create Depth with Elevation & Separation

This is starting to look great!

You might feel "funny" about the use of an arbitrary value for the custom ring-offset ðŸ™€

But consider this: if you're never going to use a `6px` ring offset anywhere else in your project... is it worth adding it as an option in your Tailwind theme?

If you find more use cases for it â€”Â by all means, extend the theme with it.

But resisting premature abstraction by using an arbitrary value to begin with is a good approach.
