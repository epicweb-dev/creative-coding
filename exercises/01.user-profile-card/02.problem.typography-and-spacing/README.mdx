# Refine Typography and Spacing

The typography on this card is a little "all over the place".

The design is relying too much on font size and font weight to create hierarchy.

Instead, we can use better spacing between elements.

## Element grouping with "white space"

We want to "collocate" the user name and joined date information. We can do that by adding separation from the other elements on the card!

🐨 Add a `margin-top` level `8` to the `<h1>{user.name}</h1>` element.

🐨 Add a `margin-top` level `8` to the `<p>{user.bio}</p>` element.

	If you read that [margins are
	bad](https://twitter.com/search?q=margins%20are%20bad%20CSS&src=typed_query&f=top)
	and prefer to use the `gap` property to handle, you can! You'll just need to
	restructure the HTML a little to make it happen.

## Reigning-in the typography

With this new breathing space between elements, we can tone down the font size and weight variation!

🐨 Change the `<h1>{user.name}</h1>` element to:

- a `font-size` of `3xl`
- a `font-weight` of `400`.

🐨 Change the `<p>{user.bio}</p>` element to:

- a `font-size` of `lg`

## Using color to influence hierarchy

We can play with text color and contrast to further dial-in the content hierarchy on the card.

🐨 Change the `<p>{user.registerDate}</p>` to the `slate-500` text color.

## Avoiding orphan words in the bio

Something that will upset many designers is to see a paragraph end up with a single word on the last line. It's called an "orphan".

The `text-wrap: pretty` CSS property — added to Tailwind CSS v3.4 — makes sure this never happens!

🐨 Add the `text-pretty` class to the `<p>{user.bio}</p>` element.
