# Optimize Text Layout

Here's another look at our starting point:

![User profile screen](/user-profile-starting-point.png)

It seems like the card is unnecessarily wide. This makes the user biography stretch out really wide, and hard to read.

You've probably heard and thought about `line-height` many times, when styling applications.

But did you stop and consider the line _length_, which is almost equally important, in terms of text legibility and visual appeal?

## Line length and legibility

Line length matters a whole lot in how easy (or hard!) it is to read text.

<callout-info>
	**Rule of thumb**: The ideal line length range for long-form copy is **between 40 and 80 characters per line**.

    - You can go **lower** for shorter bits of text ‚Äî like a mini user bio.
    - Going **higher** rarely works, regardless of how much text you are
    displaying.

</callout-info>

That 40 to 80 range is the sweet spot where the reader's eyes have the least work to do.

### Too wide

If the line length is too wide, eyes have to travel too far to the next line. It makes it easy to accidentally skip a line, or start reading the same line again.

### Too narrow

Narrow text leads to very frequent line jumps, which makes the reader do unnecessary eye gymnastics.

### It is critical for long-form copy

The longer the text, the more important it is to keep the line length in check, because the "strain" on the reader's eyes will build up, and up.

### Short copy

For short copy like a mini user biography, a tweet, or a short testimonial, it's fine to go a bit narrower in line width. Let's embrace that to make our user profile card more appealing!

## Time to get to work

üê® Change the max-width container on the user profile card from `7xl` to `md`.

üê® Add some horizontal padding (level 8) on that same element.
