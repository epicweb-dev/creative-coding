# Refine Typography and Spacing

Great stuff 👏!

We've re-created the visual hierarchy of our user profile information in a more polished way.

The large font size with bold weight on the title was kinda "yelling at us" and **taking too much attention**, in retrospect.

Flip back and forth between the problem and solution tabs to see for yourself!

## A quick word on centered text

Generally speaking, you should not use centered text for long paragraphs of text.

The user biography is short enough for it to work well with text centering, but if it was any longer, you should probably left-align it.

Again, it not only about aesthetics — but about the amount of eye gymnastics you're enforcing on the reader.
