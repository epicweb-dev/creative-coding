# Aesthetic Touches

Our profile card redesign is done!

Since most the changes were small, incremental design tweaks, it's easy to overlook how much of an impact our work had on the overall look and feel of the card.

So here's a before/after comparison for you:

## Before

## After

That's quite a stark difference, isn't it?

Great work âœ¨
